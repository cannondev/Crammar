Welcome. to Crammar. A tool I @cannondev built to help me read faster and fish more during Sophomore Summer 25X. It uses Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP) and the Adobe Extract PDF API to read large amounts of text at rates faster than reading from left to right across a page. You are using it right now. Pretty cool right. If you also want to spend more time outdoors this summer, click the button at the top right of this page and upload your readings that are due tomorrow or yesterday or last week. Your future self will thank you. Now that is Amazing.
